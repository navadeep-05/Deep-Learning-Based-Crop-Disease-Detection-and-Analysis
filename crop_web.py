    Welcome to the Plant Disease Recognition System! üåøüîç
    
    Our mission is to help in identifying plant diseases efficiently. Upload an image of a plant, and our system will analyze it to detect any signs of diseases. Together, let's protect our crops and ensure a healthier harvest!

    ### How It Works
    1. **Upload Image:** Go to the **Disease Recognition** page and upload an image of a plant with suspected diseases.
    2. **Analysis:** Our system will process the image using advanced algorithms to identify potential diseases.
    3. **Results:** View the results and recommendations for further action.

    ### Why Choose Us?
    - **Accuracy:** Our system utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for accurate disease detection.
    - **User-Friendly:** Simple and intuitive interface for seamless user experience.
    - **Fast and Efficient:** Receive results in seconds, allowing for quick decision-making.

    ### Get Started
    Click on the **Disease Recognition** page in the sidebar to upload an image and experience the power of our Plant Disease Recognition System!

                #### About Dataset
                This dataset is recreated using offline augmentation from the original dataset.The original dataset can be found on this github repo.
                This dataset consists of about 87K rgb images of healthy and diseased crop leaves which is categorized into 38 different classes.The total dataset is divided into 80/20 ratio of training and validation set preserving the directory structure.
                A new directory containing 33 test images is created later for prediction purpose.
                ## About the Plant Disease Recognition System
                This project aims to assist in the early detection of diseases in crop leaves by leveraging deep learning models. Early detection of plant diseases can significantly impact agricultural productivity, enabling farmers to take preventive measures before the diseases spread.
                ### Purpose
                * This system uses advanced image recognition techniques to classify plant leaves as either healthy or diseased, providing a user-friendly interface where farmers and researchers can upload leaf images for diagnosis. 
                
                * The model used here is based on TensorFlow and has been trained to accurately identify a variety of diseases across different types of crops.
                #### Content
                The images have been split into training, validation, and test sets using an 80/20 distribution while maintaining the original directory structure of the dataset:
                
                1. train (70295 images)
                2. test (33 images)
                3. validation (17572 images)

                ### Model and Prediction
                The deep learning model employed here is a convolutional neural network (CNN) built using TensorFlow and Keras. The model has been trained to accurately predict the presence of diseases based on leaf images provided by the user.
