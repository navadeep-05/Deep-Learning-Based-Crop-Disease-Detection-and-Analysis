    Welcome to the Plant Disease Recognition System! üåøüîç

    Our mission is to help in identifying plant diseases efficiently. Upload an image of a plant, and our system will analyze it to detect any signs of diseases.

    ### How It Works
    1. **Upload Image:** Go to the **Disease Recognition** page and upload an image of a plant with suspected diseases.
    2. **Analysis:** Our system will process the image using advanced algorithms to identify potential diseases.
    3. **Results:** View the results and recommendations for further action.

    ### Why Choose Us?
    - **Accuracy:** State-of-the-art machine learning techniques for accurate detection.
    - **User-Friendly:** Simple and intuitive interface.
    - **Fast and Efficient:** Results in seconds for quick action.

    ### Get Started
    Click on the **Disease Recognition** page in the sidebar to begin!
    
    ### About Us

    #### About Dataset
    This dataset contains ~87K RGB images of healthy and diseased crop leaves across 38 classes. It is split into training, validation, and test sets.

    ### Project Purpose
    Assist in early disease detection using deep learning for improved crop yield.

    ### System
    - Built with TensorFlow/Keras
    - Uses CNN model to classify diseases in crop leaves

    ### Dataset Split
    - Train: 70295 images
    - Validation: 17572 images
    - Test: 33 images
